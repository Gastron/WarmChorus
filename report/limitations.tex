\subsection{Limitations}
Since the algorithm adds some delay, which ends up sounding quite reverberant, it limits the possibilities for combining with other processing. The original idea was to create an all-in-one algorithm \cite{dudas}. This also limits the possibilities for using the algorithm for already processed or otherwise reverberant audio.

The frequency domain processing, when listened to in isolation, is not very audible. More audible parameter values seemed also to produce some fluttering.
