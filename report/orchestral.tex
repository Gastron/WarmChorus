\subsection{Orchestral Section Model}

Orchestral section model is based on real orchestra section and it takes account
placement and playing skills of players. Meaning that the different players play 
different amount out of tune and usually the worst players are placed in the back of
the section.\cite{dudas}

This is completely new way of thinking about chorus as its interest are based on physical
modeling rather than computational tricks. As the current chorus has parameters as modulation 
depth and modulation speed orchestral section model has more real life parameters. Dudas' warm 
chorus algorithm is mainly based on such a model \cite{dudas}.
