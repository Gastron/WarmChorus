\section{Introduction}

Chorus is an effect which purpose is make sound bigger. It simulates that
instead of one player or singer there are multple ones. 

Dudas was assigned to create chorus effect for New Asia String Quartet to get more
ensemble-like sound for Haydn's Seven Last Words, Op.51, performance. Using digital effect
was appropriate as they were using amplification and artificial reverb as well. 
As current chorus effects sound unnatural and they have detectable modulation
and beating effects Dudas decided to design new chorus algorithm, Warm Chorus. 
This algorithm is more based on physical phenomena than just simple mathematical 
consepts. \cite{dudas}

In this report we discuss about implementing Warm Chorus algorithm and how it is
better than current chorus algorithms. As well we describe in detail how we have 
implemented the algorithm.
