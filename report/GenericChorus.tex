\subsection{Generic Chorus}

Generic chorus algorithm is basd on calcunational motivation. The algorithm has three basic
fuctions. First it multiplies input signal and delays the copies and then detunes those to create
the effect of more than on player. That creates beating effect and other unwanted characteristics into
the sound due to lack of the variance of the parameters used. 

Industry standard chorus is based on delay line modulated with low-frequency oscillator.
