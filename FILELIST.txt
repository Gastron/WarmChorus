This document lists the Matlab files.

EXAMPLE.m
	- An example script for the user. Try this first. 
WarmChorus.m
	- The main function, WarmChorus(), the one that the user should call.
WCHarmoniser.m
	- The most important processing block
WCFirstFilter.m
	- A first-order finite impulse response filter.
WCFreqDomainProcess.m
	- The frequency domain processing bundled into one function.
WCHadamard.m
	- A Hadamard matrix which diffuses the sound.
WCM2S.m
	- Converts metres to samples.
WCMultiTapDelay.m
	- Returns multiple delayed copies of the signal.
WCRandRamp.m
	- Randomly ramps the gain of the signal.
WCSTFT.m
	- Implements the short time Fourier transform.
WCISTFT.m
	- Implements the inverse short time Fourier transform
WCWindowDesign.m
	- An architecht's dream Matlab function: creates a beautiful glass window for a toilet. Just kidding; this is used to make sure we use the same windowing in both the forward and inverse short time Fourier transforms.
